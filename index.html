                This webpage will serve as a teaching tool for the various conflict management styles within the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument. 
                On this webpage there are a series of videos that provide commentary on different clips from a variety of media such as Movies, Television, and Animation. 
                The commentary will appear throughout or at the end of a clip. Each commentator will identify and discuss various communication conflict management styles from the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument present within their clip. 
                The hope is that someone using this webpage can watch these clips and learn from the commentary on how and when to use a particular conflict management style of Communication from the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument. 
                Each video is paired with a brief summary of bullet points regarding the information discussed in the commentary. 
                At the bottom of the webpage there is a list of references that the commentators used as research materials for the analysis of their clip. 
                These references are formatted in APA style and contain links to their article or video source.

                    <h3>Cynthia's Commentary Summary</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Playful teasing can be used to avoid direct conflict, sidestepping confrontations and maintain a lighter atmosphere. </li>
                        <li>Within teasing, there can be an underlying competitive aspect hinting at a subtle power play or control of a social dynamic.</li>
                        <li>Competitive natures can be constantly seeking authority and recognition, rarely accommodating others' perspectives if they contradict their own. </li>
                        <li>Being confrontational can be less about avoidance and more about direct competition, often exacerbating conflicts, leading to larger issues.</li>
                        <li>Avoiding direct conflicts by deflecting or ignoring issues rather than addressing them through.</li>
                        <li>Avoidance through using humor or diversionary tactics to evade direct confrontations, aiming to maintain harmony, can worsen situations and allow underlying tensions to grow, resulting in more significant issues.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Marco's Commentary Summary</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Entering a situation with confident body language can be both assertive and cooperative.</li>
                        <li>Despite confident body language, if someone is avoiding a conflict, where one doesn't directly deal with concerns, they show a struggle between being assertive and avoiding the issue.</li>
                        <li>As a confrontation gets more intense, it is important to pay attention to the emotions and body language of yourself and others.</li>
                        <li>Staying assertive, with a guarded stance shows a mix of both competing and avoiding.</li> 
                        <li>Strong emotions in the background can affect how conflict management styles change in a given situation.</li> 
                        <li>Despite competitive mindsets, professional legal disputes require both compromise and collaboration, showing how conflict resolution strategies can be flexible.</li>

                        <li>Being assertive and uncooperative, can result in harming and disregarding the feelings of others</li>
                        <li>Using the Accommodating Style can result in unassertive, but cooperative, mindsets, usually trying to gently make requests.</li>
                        <li>Shifting to a Competing Style after trying an Accommodating Style, one can become assertive and uncooperative, choosing to aggressively confront others.</li>

                    <h3>Chris' Commentary Summary</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Competing Style should be used where swift and conclusive action is critical.</li>
                        <li>The Competing Style is ideal when it is necessary to embark on a less favored or unconventional course of action.</li>
                        <li>Using both the Accommodating and Avoidance Styles can both maintain peace and reduce social pressure.</li>  
                        <li>While it might seem nice to lean towards Collaborating, that style should be reserved for important issues that warrant the meaningful use of time and energy.</li>
                        <li>It should be noted that conflict is unavoidable, but if managed properly, a positive outcome can be achieved.</li>
